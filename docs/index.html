            trying to help others find their way to Glåüm.

        <h2 class="mb-4">About</h2>
        <h4 class="mb-4">Why should I camp with Glåüm?</h4>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Burning Man (and its regional burns) is more than just a festival. It operates on the 10
          principles, and creates a temporary civilization that defies the rules of conventional
          society. Decommodification being one of those principles, the offerings at these festivals
          are completely donative. This means that all of the sound stages, interactive art, and
          workshops at the event are gifted by participants. This also means that YOU are the event.
          No one is hiring artists or musicians to perform for you. That is what makes all of the
          art and music so special. All of the art and performances enjoyed at these festivals is
          gifted by members of the festival. And there is an overwhelming amount of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          By being part of a camp, you are actively participating in the event and giving back. It’s
          not a requirement to join a camp, and there’s nothing wrong with attending the event as a
          participant- that’s what general camping is for. However, by contributing to the event by
          participating in a camp, you are actively integrating yourself in the fabric of what makes
          the festival what it is. Not only is this a great feeling, but it makes accepting the
          wonderful offerings of these festivals so much easier, because you have the knowledge that
          you are giving back and contributing equally.

        <h2 class="mb-4">Expectations</h2>
        <h4 class="mb-4">So what does it mean to camp with Glåüm?</h4>

        <p class="mb-4">When you join the Camp of Glåüm, it is expected that you will:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc mx-10 mb-6">
          <li> Be available to your team and fill out any forms mentioned in the Slack channel.</li>
          <li> Pay camp dues ($40) </li>
          <li> Sign up for one two-hour shift as either a curator or a greeter in the Glåüm tent.</li>
          <li> Join a pod and, as a group, fulfill the requirements of that pod.</li>
          <li> Spread the good word of Glåüm.</li>
          <li> Be your best self, show up fully, and follow the 10 principles.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Additionally each pod will have a pod lead. This person will do their best to guide their
          pod and offer direction, and act as the main liaison to the camp lead. This is an
          additional responsibility and is in no way required, however does come with extra Glåüm
          points!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="roles" class="pt-48 sm:pt-32 pb-20 xs:pb-32 mx-auto bg-white bg-opacity-10">
      <div class="max-w-3xl mx-4 sm:mx-auto">
        <h2 class="mb-4">Roles</h2>

        <h5 class="mb-4">Curator/Greeter Shifts</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The Glåüm tent is an area where people are encouraged to come inside, relax, be
          comfortable, and connect with others. In order to make this an inviting space where people
          want to be, we will hold opening hours where snacks and drinks are served.
          As a curator it is your job to take charge of the space. Do your best to make people feel
          comfortable and relaxed; this is your gift and offering. This is also your chance to educate people about Glåüm and its teachings!  
          If you care to, you are welcome to bring an offering of your own, for instance making pancakes or some cookies from home. This
          is not required though, and the camp will provide materials to make warm drinks.
          You are allowed and encouraged to be creative with how you curate the space, but the tone
          should be whimsical, silly and relaxing.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Of course this only works if people know that this awesome relaxing space exists. It is
          the greeters’ job to stand out front of the Glåüm tent and invite passersby to stop in and
          check out what’s going on inside. Be lively and engaging, and encourage people to stop in.

        <h2 class="mb-4">Interactivity</h2>
        <p>
          We in the Glåüm community value connection and creative expression. Our goal at BitF
          is to provide a space where people can take ease in a relaxing environment that
          facilitates genuine connection with one another.
          <br />
          We would also like to balance out that relaxation with an opportunity to drop some wicked
          dance moves and turn that stranger on the opposite end of the dance floor into your new
          best friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          We at Glåüm have curated an amazing relaxing space that we would like to open up to the
          public at BitF. We have a 20x20 hexagonal tent, filled with
          diffused lights, cushions, music, and some truly incredible people. We will be serving
          warm drinks and food throughout the evening to accommodate a restful atmosphere.
          Passersby are encouraged to take cover from the sun and dust and close their eyes as
          one of our members serves them warm apple cider, pancakes and cookies.
          The tone is whimsical, silly and relaxing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's an amazing space, and we take radical inclusion seriously. We believe everyone should
          be included in Glåüm. Radically. This is why we make it a priority to recruit as many
          people to our lifestyle as possible. Everyone is welcome, and in fact strongly encouraged,
          to join Glåüm, and a Glåüm initiation ceremony is held at the end of the week. We
          understand that not everybody knows about Glåüm. This is a problem. That is why members
          make it a priority to spread the good word of Glåüm to as many people as they can through
          their time at BitF. Camp members are supplied with Glåüm pamphlets outlining
          Glåüm's literature, member testimonials, and, most importantly, the time, date and
          location of our Glåüm initiation ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those interested in accepting Glåüm into their hearts and joining our community are
          invited to recite their Glåüm vows at our ceremony. Once the initiation is complete, there
          will be a post-initiation dance party to celebrate the joining of our new brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          The post-initiation party will be complete with a set of Glåüm's most notorious DJs, and
          there will be a bar serving Glåüm's signature cocktail.
