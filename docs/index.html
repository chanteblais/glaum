            The world is a complicated place. We are constantly faced with so many options and
            decisions, it can be hard to know what is Glåüm and what is wrong. So many struggle to
            find meaning, value, and a sense of completion. This is why our members are always
            trying to help others find their way to Glåüm.

        <h4 class="mb-4">Why should I camp with Glåüm?</h4>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Burning Man (and its regional burns) is more than just a festival. It operates on the 10
          principles, and creates a temporary civilization that defies the rules of conventional
          society. Decommodification being one of those principles, the offerings at these festivals
          are completely donative. This means that all of the sound stages, interactive art, and
          workshops at the event are gifted by participants. This also means that YOU are the event.
          No one is hiring artists or musicians to perform for you. That is what makes all of the
          art and music so special. All of the art and performances enjoyed at these festivals is
          gifted by members of the festival. And there is an overwhelming amount of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          By being part of a camp, you are actively participating in the event and giving back. It’s
          not a requirement to join a camp, and there’s nothing wrong with attending the event as a
          participant- that’s what general camping is for. However, by contributing to the event by
          participating in a camp, you are actively integrating yourself in the fabric of what makes
          the festival what it is. Not only is this a great feeling, but it makes accepting the
          wonderful offerings of these festivals so much easier, because you have the knowledge that
          you are giving back and contributing equally.

      <div class="mb-12">
        <h4 class="mb-4">So what does it mean to camp with Glåüm?</h4>

        <p class="mb-4">When you join the Camp of Glåüm, it is expected that you will:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc mx-10 mb-6">
          <li>Be available to your team and fill out any forms mentioned in the Slack channel.</li>
          <li>
            Pay camp dues ($60) Sign up for two one-hour shifts as either a curator or a greeter in
            the Glåüm tent.
          </li>
          <li>Join a pod and, as a group, fulfill the requirements of that pod.</li>
          <li>Spread the good word of Glåüm.</li>
          <li>Be your best self, show up fully, and follow the 10 principles.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Additionally each pod will have a pod lead. This person will do their best to guide their
          pod and offer direction, and act as the main liaison to the camp lead. This is an
          additional responsibility and is in no way required, however does come with extra Glåüm
          points!
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="roles" class="pt-32 pb-20 xs:pb-32 mx-auto bg-white bg-opacity-10">
      <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        <h2 class="mb-4">Roles</h2>

        <h5 class="mb-4">Curator/Greeter Shifts</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The Glåüm tent is an area where people are encouraged to come inside, relax, be
          comfortable, and connect with others. In order to make this an inviting space where people
          want to be, we will hold opening hours where passively interactive activities are held.
          What this means is up for interpretation. As a curator it is your job to take charge of
          the space with your offering. Perhaps you could read from a saucy romance novel, narrate
          Shakespearean Star Wars, or recite some Victorian poetry. You are allowed and encouraged
          to be creative with how you curate the space, but the tone should be whimsical, silly and
          relaxing.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Of course this only works if people know that this awesome relaxing space exists. It is
          the greeters’ job to stand out front of the Glåüm tent and invite passersby to stop in and
          check out what’s going on inside. Be lively and engaging, and encourage people to stop in.
        </p>

        <h5 class="pt-4 mb-4">Sound Pod</h5>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Our Glåüm initiation ceremony will celebrate its new brethren by throwing a dance party.
          This will require:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc mx-10 mb-6">
          <li>A DJ booth</li>
          <li>Generator</li>
          <li>Speakers</li>
          <li>DJs</li>
          <li>Visuals</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="pt-4 mb-4">Bar Pod</h5>

        <p class="mb-4">
          During our initiation party, we will provide a bar offering Glåüm’s signature cocktail.
          Bar Pod is responsible for: Coming up with Glåüm’s signature cocktail. Find out what
          ingredients are required. Purchasing required ingredients and sending an invoice to the
          camp lead. Creating a bar to serve drinks. Bringing ice for drinks. Bartending during the
          initiation party.
        </p>

        <h5 class="pt-4 mb-4">Decor Pod</h5>
        <p class="mb-4">
          One of our offerings at BiTF is a relaxing environment where people can take refuge from
          the hustle and bustle of a very stimulating event and enjoy a calm atmosphere. The Glåüm
          tent is a place where passersby should feel drawn towards and at ease upon entering. To
          this end, the Decor Pod is responsible for creating a comfortable space. This includes the
          following:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc mx-10 mb-6">
          <li>
            Flooring: Carpet/canvas/other- something that makes the space feel indoorsy, and keeps
            people clean, dry and warm upon entering and sitting in the tent.
          </li>

          <li>
            Cushions/Blankets: Things for people to sit on and get comfy in. We want to make people
            as comfortable in the space as possible.
          </li>

          <li>
            Lighting: Lighting makes the space! This will require coordination with the electrical
            pod.
          </li>

          <li>
            Heat: Expect temperatures to drop as low as 2-4 degrees this year. Merit is a desert,
            and historically dry during September, but it will get cold at night. For this reason we
            will want to run some form of heater. This will require coordination with the electrical
            pod.
          </li>

          <li>
            General aesthetic: Glåüm appreciates beauty and presentation, and it’s important that
            our space looks the part!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Electrical Pod (2-5) This pod is responsible for supporting the Decor and Sound Pods and
          making sure they can run music, lights and heat. Set Up Pod (5-7) Setting up the Glåüm
          tent at the start of the event. Tear Down Pod (5-7) Tearing down and packing up the Glåüm
          tent at the end of the event. LNT Pod (1) Making sure there is no trace left at the end of
          our time in the space. This is a coordinated effort made by everyone, but LNT is
          responsible for coordinating it.

        <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        <p>
          We in the Glåüm community value connection and creative expression. Our goal at Burning
          Man is to provide a space where people can take ease in a relaxing environment that
          facilitates genuine connection with one another.
          <br />
          We would also like to balance out that relaxation with an opportunity to drop some wicked
          dance moves and turn that stranger on the opposite end of the dance floor into your new
          best friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          We at Glåüm have curated an amazing relaxing space that we would like to open up to the
          public at Burning Man. We have a geodesic dome measuring 26ft in diameter, filled with
          diffused lights, cushions, music, and some truly incredible people. We will hold readings
          and quiet performances throughout the day to accommodate a restful atmosphere. Passersby
          are encouraged to take cover from the sun and dust and close their eyes as one of our
          members reads from a saucy romance novel, narrates Shakespearean Star Wars, or recites
          some Victorian poetry. The tone of the performances is whimsical, silly and relaxing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's an amazing space, and we take radical inclusion seriously. We believe everyone should
          be included in Glåüm. Radically. This is why we make it a priority to recruit as many
          people to our lifestyle as possible. Everyone is welcome, and in fact strongly encouraged,
          to join Glåüm, and a Glåüm initiation ceremony is held at the end of the week. We
          understand that not everybody knows about Glåüm. This is a problem. That is why members
          make it a priority to spread the good word of Glåüm to as many people as they can through
          their time at Burning Man. Camp members are supplied with Glåüm pamphlets outlining
          Glåüm's literature, member testimonials, and, most importantly, the time, date and
          location of our Glåüm initiation ceremony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those interested in accepting Glåüm into their hearts and joining our community are
          invited to recite their Glåüm vows at our ceremony. Once the initiation is complete, there
          will be a post-initiation dance party to celebrate the joining of our new brethren.
        </p>
        <p>
          The post-initiation party will be complete with a set of Glåüm's most notorious DJs, and
          there will be a bar serving Glåüm's signature cocktail.
